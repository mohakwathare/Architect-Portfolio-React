I am Radhika Goyal. I am the most amazing architect there is. I am the most amazing woman there is. And I have the most intoxicating smile in the entire world. My fellow buddies are proud to call me "their best friend" in the entire world. I am an avid practitioner of philanthropy in the sense that I give and give and give my heart out to all my fellow human beings with no expectations in return.


I am one of the most beautiful and mesmerising person there is. And to say the least I love and tolerate my boyfriend so much that I let him surprise me with this even though this was his first website and he didn't know much about website design and development before this. 
P.S. he's the reacher and I am the settler.
