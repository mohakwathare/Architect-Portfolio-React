I am Radhika Goyal. "An architectâ€™s mind cannot be read but rather experienced. In moments of world explorations, I wondered how buildings molded cities and over the years, I knew I wanted to be a creator". 

I grew up in the metropolitan city of New Delhi, experiencing the everyday dynamics between city and its residents. Immersing myself in these holistic architectural environments, undertaking Architecture studies and creating similar experiences seemed like the natural path.

I graduated with a Gold Medal and a first class distinction from Sushant School of Art and Architecture.
