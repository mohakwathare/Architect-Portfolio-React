I close my eyes
Slipping into semi consciousness
Running the day through my mind
Weaving threads into the horizonless.
They start to scare
When I wake up in my dreams
Finding myself paralysed
I havnâ€™t woken subtly it seems.
Nights go running by
and I start to discreetly enjoy
The weakness of a surreal dream
As it rarely comes alive
