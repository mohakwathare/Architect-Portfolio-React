I lay in the dark
With a burn on my foot
I look out the window
And there is a silhouette

It looks funny
And pretty happy
Unlike myself
I look kind of crappy

Giving up is not so easy
Keeping up is also hard
Each path pose difficulties
But i am holding my part

I want to give up
But i need to hold on
This battle between need and want
Will continue as it goes on
