Words I leave behind

linger with shadows of my past

Days long for a ray of light

As I sit in the dark

 

Thinking about all that I could be

Worrying about all that I am

Life ceases to live

But thoughts are rushing too fast

A day I wait for

when this ends

Life will cease to exist

once and for all.
