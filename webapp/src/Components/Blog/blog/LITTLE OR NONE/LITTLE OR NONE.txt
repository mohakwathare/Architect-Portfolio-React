Tell me about yourself
I am all ears to see through
Have a pinch of faith, you should
A friend to be true to

You eyes look far
Hitting the wall, it’s tense
The weight of your sorrow
Can’t see through the opaque lens

The threads of anxiety
Choke my throat
My words are silent
Sail me in your boat

Speak anyway cause I will listen
To understand with empathy
You need me to be away
My anxiety says sorry
