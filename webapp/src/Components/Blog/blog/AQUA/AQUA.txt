Fears share the pain

A wild dream again

Fear second upon a clock

Passing hours they presented a rock

A stop they chase to get ashore

Running fast jump to a lure

An elude hopeful to unknown land

Of stories’ fantasies’ castles of sand

 

You read me books of origins apart

A slender touch of your scent I puffed as we start

A scent so strong, I reach forward to feel

A familiar ache keeps me stuck on my heel

A hand lent me to share a sky

I hold it in my dreams, in real too shy

A tuft of hair, in wrinkles a forehead

Of brows intense, a brain so morbid

 

High walls of steps that lead to the other side

Climbed up and falling apart from the gaze in those eyes

A promise of vagabond heart

To look beyond shattered parts

Tales so intent on being shared

A heart so blessed to be cared

A searchlight burnt to ashes in fire

Finding a way to continue till we tire

 

Wrapping my head around a water bearer

Stumbling away to swim in those waves

Deepest corners of an ocean so bizarre

I rest my head in the cups of your arms.
