Touch me not
Cause i am sensitive
I will wither
At the slightest cringe in voice
Call me gently
Treat me right
I am a paradox
Give me some time

Show me care
Not just kindness
Do not hunt for mistakes
On my way to nowhere
Cause i will make them
For a reason i am unaware

Give me comfort
If not support
Understand my anxiety
If not my words
Speak without ego
Give me some love
Treat me as a child
Comfort me in your arms
Tell me a story
That i just drown
In a world of possibilities
Than merely a frown
