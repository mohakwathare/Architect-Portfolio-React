Leaves begin to fall at the break of dawn

How strange it is, to see them gone

At the moment when a new season began

They surrendered themselves to an estranged plan

They grew apart from the seed that sourced

A false premise, a shade they endorsed

Falling hard on the doomed ground

Heavy from all the truth they found

A rush of water never appeared so bound

Every petal, every leaf I saved, but drowned.
