as I look around
Feeling illiterate
All the things
In a gust of wind
Give me a reason
To learn a little more
Everyday

Time seems to be unfair
And i seem to be falling for it
Just a little more
Everyday

My knowledge is finite
My memory doesnâ€™t remember
The memories of my childhood
And i seem to forget the few special ones
Just a little more
Everyday

In the years to come
my Future seems very bleak
I am living in a bubble
Which keeps on getting opaque
Just a little more
Everyday

My heart lusts for love
And my mind builds a wall
I try to break it enough
Just a little more
Everyday

My eyes see what i wish for
My words seem to vanish
I hear the voices in my mind
That cradle me with a blemish
And i seem to lose myself
Just a little more
Everyday

I wish for a life
Closer to heaven
As i act strange
And my life seems to die
Just a little more
Everyday

My love, i wish you
All the happiness
As i seem to feel it
Just a little less
Everyday
