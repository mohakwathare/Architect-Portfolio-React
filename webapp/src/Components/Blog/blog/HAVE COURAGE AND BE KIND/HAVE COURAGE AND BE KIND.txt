Something Cinderella’s mother told her to help her cross the paths and struggles of life. There’s no real mantra to get through life.

Look here, I stand at ease

My legs feel tired and mind is a tease

My dreams keep running back to that face

It’s difficult to run in the life’s race
I’d be somewhere else I’d like

To be non existent and gaze at people at night

Dragging along the steps towards nothing

Faking a smile to hide something
A few pearls of wisdom let out of sight

A blurry face, that looks so fine

Its strange that its my vision unclear

unable to see anything without fear
