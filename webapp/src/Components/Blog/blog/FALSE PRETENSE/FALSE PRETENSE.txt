His vision locks on something lost

A child confined to unseen boundaries

A step forward over the post

Threaten a smile devoid of any worries

 

Sweet melody of an unsung song

He hums all the way to infinity

Little notes of joy add a spring in his step

As the song comes alive in all its glory

 

He walks with a senselessness

Being oblivious to his traits

Searching for faults in his convictions

But unable to uncover any parallels

 

Keeping his thoughts to himself

He tread along the conversations

Thinking loud and clear

Subcounscious of all the miscalculations

 

Lost in all purpose

Impervious to the lies

A gamble his mind plays

Between mysticm and the truth in his eyes
