A little out of place

Everything seems to me

Some strange hopelessness

A thought I canâ€™t flee

 

Most lifeless a plant ever seen

Withered leaves, roots beneath

The sun makes a glance, a stare it seems

Flowers fall away, to prepare a wreath

 

A reflection of myself in the name of truth

Mirrors see me as an unknown creature

Once lively and mischievious

Now bowed down by judgement and a teacher

 

I crave for sunshine and a day of lust

Some winds in my hair without a care in the world

A day when I can give up on myself

Just some courage and wise words
