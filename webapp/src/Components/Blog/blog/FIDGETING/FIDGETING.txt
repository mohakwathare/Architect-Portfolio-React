Some distractions to make out

Old pinch of complexities

mildly low on confidence

Fears running back to see

 

ways that I cannot change

for ways I am sorry for

to walk and never look back

fearing to stumble and fall

 

at the tick of every second passing

how will I beat my future

If the present is a mess in making

can I cheat self inflicted turture

 

Each second may be happy

a strange fear of being so

did I hold to chains too strong

No way out of the door
