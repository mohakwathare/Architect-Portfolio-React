Faces glow bright in the darkness of sins

The kind she never discovered before

A light so strong shining from within

It broke all barriers, every word she swore

 

She smiled for those ferocious heavens

She spoke with an undeniable truth

Least did she know, limited was every second

For she stumbled upon her waning youth

 

A song here, she sang with poise

A step there, she danced with glee

It became nothing more than a noise

When she saw something sheâ€™d never seen

 

An unspoken truth and a presumed fact

Nothing lasts forever, but all that lurks

Are the last words recited in an act

Before she chose silence over words.
