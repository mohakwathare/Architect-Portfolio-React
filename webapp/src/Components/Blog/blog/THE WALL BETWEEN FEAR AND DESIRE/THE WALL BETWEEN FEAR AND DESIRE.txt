this is something I have come to realise that Fear is the feeling when you know you are going to lose something. That something could be your self-respect, your freedom, your love, your integrity, your sanity, your opinion, etc. What you desire is not what you have right now. You don’t have the position you want, the person you love, the house you want, the passion you want to pursue; but you have fear, fear of not getting what you want..which is actually the fear when you lose your self-satisfaction and contentment.
You lose what you own, you gain what you fear.so..gain what you own and lose what you fear.
Future is a complicated aspect of life and the present is what you can’t lose. You have lost the past which is the fear of change. You haven’t gained the future which is the fear of uncertainty. You have the present but haven’t gained the confidence and awareness to live it fully to your satisfaction, which is where you lose the desire, thus the fear.
Then there is the fear of unacceptance by others. That is actually when you are losing your power over the fact that you are an individual who has the right to make mistakes and live life on your terms. You win over that fear when you gain consciousness of your self-worth and individuality.

Anger is another form of fear where you are afraid of losing your hold over the situation, of putting your ego on a knife and being vulnerable.
So much fear in your world, stop losing yourself and gain yourself instead.
What are you afraid of?
