Who sees what we see
the lines that don’t meet
the paths that don’t lead
the colors that fail to greet
and the minds that don’t read.

In the battle between reality and thoughts
the reality is quite subtle
the thoughts create a storm
but what about the reality of my thoughts

I am sick, I can’t get up
I walk but I can’t take another step
I breathe but my mind is choking me
I talk but my words are fake
I see but my visions are blurry

What is satisfaction
What is holding on
do I hold on to the reality without thoughts
do I hold on to the hope of my betterment
do I hold on to the current chaos
I want to let go of all the realities
the future that might be
the future that I can see
that’s not the future i want to be in
and there can’t be another future
till I heal.
