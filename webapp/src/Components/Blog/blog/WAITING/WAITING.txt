I wait and wait and wait
I wait for night
I wait for light,
I wait for clouds
I wait for rain,
And most of all
I wait for a voice
As sweet as an infant
As true as the last rites,
As understanding as a mother
As beautiful as innocent eyes.

I wait for a sight
In the dark of all light
That will see the path,
And accompany me
During the misty night.

I wait for a face
As gentle as a ray
To come through in front
And make me stay.

When the days pass
Make me a promise
As strong as the sun
And silent as a river
that day i state
Iâ€™ll end my wait
