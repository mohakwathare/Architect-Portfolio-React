The way clouds flare light

A heaven on earth they create in love

I look at the trees branching to fight

Some streaks, some dew, some leaves untouched

 

A faint idea rising afloat

An ending unknown, a story unbound

By any stance, I came to sought

Some restlessness, some solid ground

 

Strings of words, knots of truth

Chapters closed, letters forgotten

Roots reformed, worlds reboot

Deserting everything misbegotten.
