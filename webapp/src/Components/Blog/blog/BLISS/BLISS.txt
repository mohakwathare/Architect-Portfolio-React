A beautiful coglomeration

Of songs sung in pleasure

Laughs that will echo foever

And smiles that make the world better

 

Strings of thoughts run free and wild

Words of worth shine and glare

The glimmering eyes cast an inner child

And dancing feet show the love they share

 

Four minds of twelve year olds

Talk about ten years of fate

Some memories unfold

Many new ones made
