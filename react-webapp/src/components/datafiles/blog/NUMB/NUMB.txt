Feel the touch of sensitivity

A strained nerve tore in twain

Ignorance parts a play mislead

Applauded by silent fall of rain

 

Thunderous clouds roar a voice

Loud enough to break position

A face, a mask , a shadow sentenced

For faithless acts of humiliation

 

Like the theory of  a reversing clock

over a cup of hot brewed coffee

I reveal my convictions and reveries

Never was I so fluent being a zombie

 

A stranger with conspicuous motives

lures me into a den of hope

some words, some plays, some eyes so dense

I stand except my walls seem broke

 

Thousands of forevers few seconds later

a sliver of truth all pale and dusty

bequeathed behind a curtain of lies

makes its way to the stage so rustic

 

A torturous silence fills all ears

A crystal shatters into billion pieces

some reflect the truth, others shone a lie

The stage never hid its precious faces.

 

I stare into depths of faces so obscure

An aversion of sorts I feel so strong

I relinquish my numbness to a state of disarray

I wonder how I could be so wrong.
