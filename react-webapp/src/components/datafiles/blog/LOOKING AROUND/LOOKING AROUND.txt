I squint my eye

and I look for a treat

it’s the usual as usual

said the man on the street

“go look around ahead,

save yourself a seat!”

there are many hawkers

in search of the same kind of treat’

I point towards a fleet

of birds in the sky

said the man on the street

“do you want to fly?”

I look at my feet

with a tear in my eye

“can I manage to cheat?”

the ground makes me shy.

I stare at a child

with a soul so sweet

“want to save yourself?”

said the man on the street

is it really possible

that I am able to defeat

the conflicts of yesterday

with the eyes so sweet?
