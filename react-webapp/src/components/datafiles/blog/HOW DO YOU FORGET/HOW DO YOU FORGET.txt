How do I forget

the memories of past

which stand behind the window

that I closed for a new start

The curtains keep moving

though there is no wind

but a slight heaviness in the air

which makes me want to find

the glass is stained

with the harsh words of yesterday

what once was said in a fragile state

haunt my tomorrow today

at every tick of the clock

the possibilities seem overwhelming

what could have been evitable

became a cursed calling
