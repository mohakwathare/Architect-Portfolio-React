Who’s to say what happens next
The scenes i imagine in my little nest
When blessings become a burden
To prove that you deserve them
A battle between love and hate
I want to scream my mind
Am i just acting to be fake
or am i faking my act
The reality keeps changing
Like the shadows of my thoughts
My words hang heavy, drop and crash
The sound of which doesnt bother so much
But the broken pieces still linger in the waves
Of the ocean which dried up long ago
There’s nothing to soak up
Nothing to absorb either
All debates seem to be losing any point
For me to consider for a moment
The words others orate
To defend a stand and fight for one
Come across as a hollow sound
not one statement holds momentousness
Do i sell myself rightly
To make you fall once
That i will rise to hold you
For a moment bought
Tell me you know me
And that you can see what i am hiding
In my mind and heart
A rhythem so complex
That notes fail to produce something worth listening
But read my song, make me coffee
Tell me stories that distract me
Tell me you know me
And that you can see my face
Disguised as auspicious
