Gone are the days

when only trust could heal

Like A sound as loud as a lion’s roar

Or a sword as sharp as valyrian steel

 

A trust on myself I have condemned

That reflects on my shadow as dark as the grave

I talk about hopes and dreams and realms

Knowing that I care about none, to wish or rave

 

A curtain lingers over my head, evermore

Trapping  any demons struggling to escape

A play I’ve played since I came ashore

A contentment I have for a horizonless landscape

Something I havn’t quite understood

A darkness in the daylight

Oblivion of some sort

As nothing looks right

 

My purpose is clear

One I have created in belief

Looking beyond any judgement

To live a life I didn’t need

 

I will ask the skies to lend a hand

Some shades of solitude they can hold

Contemplating every memory I ever made

Letting them go like a dream untold

 

Overwhelmed in a world of even and odd

Petty moments of peace come into sight

Every demon that I ever rescued

Left me stranded in a trice

 

Distress and comfort part by a fine line

Fuse together into an enchanting shape

Where the devil offers solace

And nothing remains unsaid
